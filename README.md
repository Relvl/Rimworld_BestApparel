# Rimworld mod: BestApparel

A mod that adds a window for comparing items by various stats and filters.

For apparels/clothes/armor, it allows you to filter by layers and body parts.

For weapons - ...

Allows you to specify which stats to display and how to compare them.

### Purpose

Most likely you don't need this mod if you play in vanilla style (with a minimum number of mods).
It is needed by dudes who are greased with much mods that add a bunch of different armor and weapons, in which
complementary stats are defined.
This mod does not add any changes to the game style, items or mechanics.
All it does is to quickly find the desired item according to the desired stats.
