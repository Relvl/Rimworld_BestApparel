A mod that adds a window for comparing items by various stats and filters.

For apparels/clothes/armor, it allows you to filter by layers and body parts.

Allows you to specify which stats to display and how to compare them.

The mod can be absolutely safely added and removed in existing saves.

[h1]Purpose[/h1]

Most likely you don't need this mod if you play in vanilla style (with a minimum number of mods). It is needed by dudes who are greased with much mods that add a bunch of different armor and weapons, in which complementary stats are defined. This mod does not add any changes to the game style, items or mechanics. All it does is to quickly find the desired item according to the desired stats.

[h1]Known issues[/h1]

When the Combat Extended mode is active, errors may be displayed in the console when sorting the results, if there are items in the results do not support CE. It doesn't break anything, but I can't get rid of it.
